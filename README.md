## About the Project:

# 🛡️ Red & Blue Team Cybersecurity Simulation Platform

This project is an AI-assisted cybersecurity simulation system designed to enhance both offensive (Red Team) and defensive (Blue Team) capabilities through realistic, data-driven scenarios. It provides a unified environment to analyze, simulate, and visualize cyber incidents dynamically.

# 🔴 Red Team (Attack Simulation)

Simulates real-world attack scenarios such as reconnaissance, phishing, and exploit testing.
Helps identify potential vulnerabilities and assess how systems react under simulated threat conditions.
Encourages ethical hacking practice to strengthen system security posture.

# 🔵 Blue Team (Defense Analysis)

Detects, analyzes, and responds to simulated attacks using intelligent pattern recognition.
Evaluates defense mechanisms and highlights areas requiring immediate attention.
Assists teams in improving incident response time and accuracy.

# 📊 Interactive Dashboard Overview

Displays attack paths, detection timelines, and system responses in real time.
Provides clear visual insights into how Red Team attacks evolve and how the Blue Team mitigates them.
Includes threat metrics, log summaries, and response effectiveness scores to measure defense readiness.
Enables post-simulation comparison between Red and Blue strategies for continuous learning.

# 📄 Dynamic PDF Report Generation
After each simulation, a custom analytical report is automatically generated.
The report includes attack vectors, detection outcomes, and performance summaries.
Users can download the report to document and review their cybersecurity performance.
